# Part 3

As per the course recommendation, [./phonebook](./phonebook/) is located in its own repository: [github.com/bapturp/phonebook](https://github.com/bapturp/phonebook.git).

To ease the development it's setup as a git submodule:
```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/bapturp/phonebook.git phonebook
```
